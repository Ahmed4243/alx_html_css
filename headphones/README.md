# 📄 Responsive Web Page (HTML/CSS Only)

Welcome to the **Responsive Web Page Project**! This project demonstrates a fully functional, responsive, and accessible web page built **entirely from scratch** using only **HTML and CSS**—no frameworks or libraries involved.

## 🌐 Project Description

This project replicates a provided designer layout using semantic HTML and modern CSS best practices. It features responsive design, hover interactions, and accessibility enhancements. The result is a clean, professional web page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Responsive Design**  
  The layout adjusts for different screen sizes. When the viewport is **480px or less**, the page automatically switches to a **mobile-friendly layout**.

- ✅ **Accessibility First**  
  Semantic HTML elements, alt tags for images, appropriate heading structures, and ARIA practices are used to ensure screen reader support.

- ✅ **Interactivity**  
  - Link hover & active states: `#FF6565`  
  - Button hover & active state: `opacity: 0.9`

- ✅ **Content Styling**  
  - The main content area is **centered** with a `max-width` of **1000px`
  - Fully responsive layout using `flexbox` and `media queries`

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

| Screen Width       | Layout Version   |
|--------------------|------------------|
| ≤ 480px            | Mobile Layout    |
| > 480px            | Desktop Layout   |
